# telegram-bot
Intructions for the bot

Make sure you are in the telegrambot directory in the 'this is the one :)' bash console
Once youre in the bash console type 'ls'
if you see 'telegrambot.py' and some pipfiles you're in the right spot.
It is in directory /home/createbase

run this command to start the bot:
pipenv run python3 http://telegrambot.py

To stop, hit CTRL+C twice.

If for some reason you lose that console and need to run this on a different console, you'll need to set up the environment.
install pipenv (using whatever your systems command is - on mac I did brew install pipenv)
pipenv install requests
pipenv install cryptocompare
pipenv install python-telegram-bot
